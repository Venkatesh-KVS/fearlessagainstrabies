            Rabies can be prevented by pre-exposure vaccination.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Rabies is usually treated with a post-exposure prophylactic rabies
            vaccine. However, this vaccine can be given before exposure to
            individuals who are at risk of rabies; this includes children,
            regular runners or walkers, pet owners, animal control and wildlife
            officers, and individuals who work in laboratory settings or those
            visiting areas where rabies is endemic. Pre-exposure vaccination
            eliminates the need for rabies immune globulin and reduces the
            number of doses of vaccine to be given after being exposed to
            rabies.
          </p>
          <p>
            With pre-exposure vaccination, you can now enjoy your morning jog
            and let your children play with the pets without any worry.
